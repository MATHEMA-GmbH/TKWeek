<p>Do you need to convert between a <strong>week number</strong> and a date or require some information about a date? Find out if a year is a <strong>leap year</strong>, calculate the number of days, business days, weeks, weekends, month turns and years <strong>between two dates</strong>? Want to add or subtract days, weeks or months to a given date?</p>
